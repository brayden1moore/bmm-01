Nothing to say today.
I have nothing to say today, but it's time to speak.
My interlocutor has finished speaking, and they await my reply.
What they've said was perfectly fine, and it's certainly deserving of a fine response, but I've got nothing.
I've got nothing, because as the seconds pass, I squirm and grasp for some thought or dammit even just a word.
But the thoughts and words I find are stupid and hollow. Undeserving.
I am undeserving, and now they've found me out.
And I have nothing to say today.
